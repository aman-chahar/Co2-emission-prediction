# 🚗 **Predicting CO2 Emissions from Vehicle Data using Machine Learning** 📈

In the world of data science and machine learning, I recently completed a fascinating project that involved predicting CO2 emissions from vehicle data. The project was aimed at gaining insights into how various factors like engine size, the number of cylinders, and fuel consumption impact the environment by estimating CO2 emissions.

### Project Overview:

📊 **Data Exploration**: We started by loading and exploring the dataset, checking for missing values and duplicates, and selecting the relevant features for our analysis.

📈 **Feature Engineering**: We narrowed down our focus to key features: Engine Size, Cylinder Count, and Fuel Consumption. These factors are known to influence a vehicle's CO2 emissions.

🛠 **Model Training**: We split the data into training and testing sets and used a **Linear Regression model** to train on the training data. Linear Regression is a popular choice for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features.

🧪 **Model Testing**: We evaluated the model's performance using the **R-squared (R2) score**, a common metric to assess the goodness of fit of a regression model. Our model showed a strong correlation between the predicted and actual CO2 emissions.

🔮 **Real-Life Prediction**: This is where the project becomes practical. We can now use our trained model to make real-life predictions. For instance, if you provide the specifications of a truck with an engine size of 4, 8 cylinders, and a fuel consumption rating of 12, our model can estimate its CO2 emissions.

### Why This Matters:

1. **Environmental Impact**: Understanding how vehicle features affect CO2 emissions is essential in mitigating climate change and reducing the carbon footprint of our transportation choices.

2. **Consumer Information**: Consumers can make more informed decisions when purchasing vehicles, considering their impact on the environment.

3. **Industry Insights**: The automotive industry can use such models for optimizing fuel efficiency and developing eco-friendly vehicles.

This project highlights the power of data science and machine learning in solving real-world problems and making data-driven decisions. It's a great example of how technology can contribute to environmental awareness and sustainability.
